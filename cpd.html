        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project involved designing and implementing the eLearning course a 
          <a class="text-link" href="https://ubccpd.ca/learn/learning-activities/course?eventtemplate=986">Becoming CCMD</a>
         as part of my work at Continuing Professional Development <a class="text-link" href="https://ubccpd.ca/">(UBC CPD)</a> 
          in collaboration with <a class="text-link" href="https://www.fraserhealth.ca/">Fraser Health</a>. The course is designed for Community Care Medical Directors (CCMDs), 
          who serve as leaders responsible not only for clinical oversight, but also for collaboration, advocacy, and 
          system navigation within the long-term care (LTC) sector. It emphasizes the role of strong medical leadership in 
          fostering respectful, supportive care environments where LTC residents can thrive.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was my first fully independent project, where I was responsible for end-to-end design and page implementation 
          while working closely with the Learning & Curriculum Manager and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
        </p>

      <section id="style" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">Developing visual style and colour palette</h2>
        <p>The first phase of the project focused on defining the course’s visual direction, including the illustration style 
            and colour palette. The goal was to reflect the sensitive, human-centred nature of long-term care through a muted, 
            calm palette, while still maintaining visual alignment with Fraser Health, whose brand identity includes blue 
            and orange.</p>
        <p>Following several discussions, we refined the palette to three core colours - orange, blue, and green - balancing 
            warmth, trust, and care without overwhelming learners. The illustration style was developed as clean line art 
            with soft colour fills.</p>

      <section id="course-design" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">Course design</h2>
        <p>
          My main responsibility as a designer was to work closely with existing course content and translate it into 
          engaging, accessible learning experiences. Rather than presenting information as static text, the role 
          requires re-structuring content through thoughtful layouts, visuals, and interactive elements that actively 
          support learning outcomes.
        </p>
        </section>
        <section id="timeline" class="title-text">
          <h2 class="project-sub">Timeline</h2>
          <p> 
            For example, one section of the course focused on the history of long-term care (LTC). Presenting this information 
            as plain text would have been dense and difficult to process. 
          </p>
          <figure class="project-figure">
            <img class="project-img" src="assets/img/timeline-conten t.png" alt="Timeline content">
            <figcaption class="project-caption">
              Excerpt from the storyboard developed by the Curriculum Manager, later shared with the designer 
              to explore how the content could be translated into an effective on-page experience.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>To address this, I designed an interactive timeline using the course’s established colour palette. 
            Each historical period is visually distinct and selectable, allowing learners to reveal content one period at a 
            time rather than all at once. This interaction supports progressive disclosure, reduces cognitive load, and helps 
            learners more easily track change over time.</p>

      <section id="round-buttons" class="title-text">
          <h2 class="project-sub">Buttons</h2>
          <p> 
            Beyond timelines, I incorporated additional interaction patterns to improve content clarity and comparison. 
            In sections discussing contrasting systems, such as the financial structures of publicly funded versus private 
            LTC in British Columbia, I used toggle buttons that allow learners to switch between views.  
          </p>
          <p>This approach prevents the page from feeling overloaded while enabling direct, side-by-side comparison when needed.</p>

      <section id="flip-cards" class="title-text">
          <h2 class="project-sub">Flip Cards</h2>
          <p> 
            For knowledge checks and conceptual clarification, I used flip cards to present formats such as myth vs. 
            truth and true vs. false. These interactions encourage active engagement and self-assessment without 
            interrupting the learning flow.

      <section id="infographics1" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">Inforgraphics</h2>
        <p>The course also required communicating complex data through visuals. To present statistical information, I 
          designed and developed graphs and infographics. One page, in particular, required significant iteration to balance 
          clarity, accuracy, and accessibility. </p>
        <p>I referenced design precedents to determine appropriate graph structures for visualizing resident demographics 
          by illness and levels of dependency among LTC residents. </p>

            Multiple infographic iterations testing various chart styles for clarity and effectiveness.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While multiple iterations and mockups were designed in Figma, the final version was implemented directly on 
          the page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The final design uses the course's colour palette to visually separate 
          data groups and improve scannability. Bar charts highlight the prevalence of key medical conditions, 
          while circular graphics communicate levels of ADL dependency, allowing users to quickly grasp 
          relative proportions and comparisons.</p>

      <section id="accessibility" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">Accessibility</h2>
        <p>I designed this table to summarize complex legal distinctions between different types of substitute decision makers.
           An early goal was to visually differentiate capability status so learners could quickly scan and understand which 
           roles apply under different conditions. </p>
        <p>I initially explored using colour alone to indicate status (e.g., capable, lower threshold, incapable). 
          However, when testing the design in grayscale, I found that all capability states look exactly the same, 
          making them hard to differentiate and highlighting the limitations of relying on colour alone.</p>
       
        <figure class="project-figure">
          <img class="project-img" src="assets/img/summary-table-gray.png" alt="Table">
          <figcaption class="project-caption">
            Summary of Decision Makers table in grayscale
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>To address this, I iterated on the design by introducing iconography alongside colour, using distinct visual 
          markers to reinforce each capability state. This dual-encoding approach (colour + icon) supports accessibility 
          standards and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.</p>

        <figure class="project-figure">
          <img class="project-img" src="assets/img/summary-table-colour.png" alt="Table">

      <section id="reflection" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">Reflecton</h2>
        <p>As a final reflection, I truly enjoyed my time at UBC CPD. Contributing to projects that support healthcare 
          and help medical professionals grow and expand their skills was deeply meaningful to me. This project also 
          marked my first experience working independently as the sole designer on a project, allowing me to participate 
          in external meetings and gain a deeper understanding of the eLearning course development process. I 
          learned how much time, iteration and collaboration is required to produce high-quality educational materials.
</p>
          <p>This experience helped me grow not only as a designer, but also broadened my understanding of 
            the healthcare system through working on projects related to substance use, breech birth, mental health and 
            more. I was also fortunate to collaborate with an inspiring group of people who are deeply passionate about 
            healthcare and creating meaningful impact.
