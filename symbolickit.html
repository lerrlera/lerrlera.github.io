        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden stands as one of Vancouver’s top tourist attractions, 
          located in the historical Chinatown neighbourhood of the city. However, despite its popularity, the 
          Garden lacks in providing educational value to first-time visitors. As a local museum, it falls short in 
          explaining the significance behind its structures, rooms and natural elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Symbolic Discovery Kit offers a solution to enhance understanding of the Garden's hidden symbolism for 
          first-time visitors. It serves as an alternative to guided tours, which have proven beneficial for visitors 
          in the past.
        </p>
        <p>The goal of this project was to partner up with an organization (aka a participant group) and work directly with 
            them in order to engage with and learn design methods in practice.

        <h2 class="project-sub">Ethnography: initial observations and findings</h2>
        <p>
          Our initial work primarily consisted of the insights from Lucy, Marketing and Events Manager, and Garden 
          observations. The main concerns centered around the Garden's insufficient online presence, a lack of engagement 
          with the younger generation, and a stigma associated with Chinatown.
        </p>
        <div class="outline-box">
          <p class="p-no-margin">However, we thought that the identified issues were too generic and based on only one staff member’s point of view (Lucy Lei).</p>
        </div>
        <p> 
          We initially considered several directions, including a storytelling-based app with anonymous professional guidance, 
          a map-based interface for youth-specific services, and a skill-building app focused on coping strategies and light gamification. 
          Through this process, we identified a key gap across existing solutions: youth are often expected to initiate contact and then wait without support.

        <h2 class="project-sub">Developing design personas</h2>
        <p>The next step consisted of identifying personas to help negotiate our work and narrow down our focus. 
            We chose a staff member, a young local visitor, and a senior regular visitor to distinguish each persona 
            from each other and bring another perspective to our work. I was responsible for creating content and designing 
            the persona of the staff member (Lucy) at the Garden.

        <h2 class="project-sub">Which persona made sense the most?</h2>
        <p>The persona that felt the most genuine to us was Lucy, as it was based on the actual ethnographic data obtained 
            from direct interviews. Her persona gave voice to addressing the key issues of the Garden, which were identified 
            as the lack of diversity in activities and events appealing to both locals and tourists.

          <p class="p-no-margin">Based on in-class critique, we needed to diversify the expression of our persona to anchor our

      <section id="ethnography2" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">More ethnography!</h2>
        <p>I thought it would be a good idea to visit the Garden again, try to retrace the steps of a potential visitor, and 
            talk to some visitors to gain insights from another perspective. And that is what we did! As we explored the 
            Garden, we conducted unstructured interviews with a total of 8 Garden visitors and asked them questions.

      <section id="learnings" class="title-text">
        <h2 class="project-sub">What did the second round of ethnography inform us about?</h2>
        <p>With the updated ethnographic data, we were able to re-construct our personas and create user journeys. 
            Compared to how we felt before our visit to the Garden, we felt more confident as to who our persona should be. </p>
        <p>One of the personas remained Lucy, Marketing and Events Manager, with concerns about engaging with the younger 
            audience. However, I suggested recreating our second persona to be a first-time visitor who is hoping to learn 
            something new in a fun and engaging way. In this way, we explored the perspectives of both the staff member and 
            visitor that align better with our initial and later observations.</p>

            diverse events, but rather from a failure to adequately communicate the Garden's significance throughout 
            the user's experience. This could be contributing to visitors feeling that the Garden lacks context and is 
            'missing something'.

        <p>Our workshop took place in the Garden and lasted one hour. It consisted of an icebreaker activity,

            Garden volunteers (Thomas, Wei, Frank) and 2 first-time visitors (You Mi and Sean). We also met Lita - 
            a Garden visitor who spontaneously joined our workshop briefly for just one activity.

        <p>Throughout the workshop, the staff members helped us specify that the identity of the Garden stands not only for 
            tangible but also intangible values, such as its symbolism. However, it became evident that these values are not 
            readily apparent to visitors due to a lack of touchpoints, except during guided tours. Ultimately, I concluded 
            that as interaction designers, our task is to integrate the understanding of symbolism into the visitors' journey.</p>

        <p>This project allowed me to gain practical experience in user experience and interaction design within a 
            professional setting, requiring collaboration with an external organization. I'm grateful for the opportunity 
            to learn more about Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden and the wonderful staff members who supported us 
            every step of the way. Through this experience, I significantly enhanced my skills in interaction design 
            methodologies, including creating design personas and developing effective user journeys/storyboards.</p>
          <p>Reflecting on the project, one aspect I would improve is dedicating more time to ethnography and 
            gathering additional data from Garden visitors. However, due to the course structure and time constraints, 
            we had to work with the resources available within the given timeframe.</p>
